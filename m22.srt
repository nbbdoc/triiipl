444
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,120
If he's alive.

445
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,204
in twenty-four hours...

446
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,292
we have failed.

577
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,633
Let's get in the air.

578
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,723
We are about to do something...

579
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,560
much more powerful
than kill a man.

580
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,440
We're about to kill...

581
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,318
the idea that...

582
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,402
we are weak.

606
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:35,561
You fucked me.

610
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,196
I want out of this country

611
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,281
now.

612
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:53,913
Open the disc now.

716
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:43,744
He's in the embassy.

717
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:46,580
Alive?

718
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,041
Alive.

763
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,775
Any last words for your mother?

765
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,237
Traitor.

834
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,146
How does it work?

835
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,107
As soon as he's on the move,

836
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,983
They'll switch networks.

837
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,443
That's the loophole,

838
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:56,820
that's our way in.

1272
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:23,968
Have you confirmed
with the ground team?

1273
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:25,511
Yes, they're ready.

1274
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:26,679
Good.


1253
01:18:29,831 --> 01:18:33,042
We have their location.
Let's go.

1338
01:22:58,265 --> 01:22:59,433
Madam General.

1339
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:02,269
It's almost time,
would you like to watch?

1340
01:23:02,353 --> 01:23:03,437
Yes.
